# D&D Monster Finder
D&D Monster Finder is a Dungeons & Dragons monster search application that allows people to search for monster challenge ratings and receive a random snack based on user input.


## Introduction
Before or during a game, it is often helpful know how great a threat a monster is to determine whether the party is appropriately equipped for the encounter. This application allows players to seek out information that will help them gain an edge in battle.


## Collaborators
* **Ben Martin** - The great wizard of the glade. The code is strong with this one. Always willing to lend a helping hand in our fierce battle. His quick-wittedness and powers in JavaScript brought us to victory.

* **Grant Royseth** - The valiant knight of the shade. Well-known for his ability to adapt and defend against the darkness of APIs. He was summoned to answer the threat of API.

* **Nick Mullenmeister** - The dreamer of the lost. Happens to know a thing or two about JavaScript and CSS, but often finds himself mystified. Does his best though. Could someday become a coding sorcerer.

* **Bailey Behning** - The lady of the realm. Fights for our cause, the sake of coding, and the betterment of all coders.


## User Story
As a DM (Dungeon Master) of Dungeons & Dragons:
* I want to be able to quickly and easily look up monsters I can use for my encounters.
* I want to tell at a glance what type the creature is.
* I want to know its ability scores (Strength, Dexterity, etc.).
* I want to be able to make a list of monsters I'm considering using.
* I want my list to be saved between sessions.


## General Information
Upon making a successful search, users are presented with monster cards that contain the following information: monster name, monster challenge rating, monster type, and ability scores. Monster cards can be clicked to save them to a menu, which is stored in local storage. Monsters in the menu can be clicked to remove them.


## API
[Open5e](https://open5e.com) - A Dungeons and Dragons open-source resource that includes all mosnters, spells, and more from the 5th edition of D&D. 

## Future Features
Our group has brainstormed several additional features that could be added to the application:
* When a user hovers over a saved creature, that monster's card is displayed.
* Each monster's card has a button which when clicked displays the monster's full data.
* Checkboxes could be included that would allow users to narrow down the source books that the search pulls from (e.g. just the base game, or filter for certain expansion books).
